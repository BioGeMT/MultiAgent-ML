This is a work in progress which does not work yet
The 1-shot_sela_run.py script contains and descriptions of what needs to be finished (todos). If a Todo was already addressed, it's marked as "Done" or "Edit"

The proposed way how the final solution should run.
1. run set_up.py
2. run our docker
3. conda activate agentomics_sela_tmp
4. run the run_sela.sh
